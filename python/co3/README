Installing this module
======================

To install a pre-built package file:

    pip install dist/co3-x.x.x.tar.gz


To install directly into your local Python environment:

    python setup.py install


To build the installable package file:

    python setup.py sdist --formats=gztar

This creates a single file `dist/co3-x.x.x.tar.gz` (the filename will
vary according to the current version of this repository).


To download all the dependencies so that they can be installed
onto an isolated machine from the top co3 directory:

    pip download --no-cache-dir --no-binary :all: .

This downloads various .tar.gz files that can each be copied to
your target machine and installed with 'pip install <file>.tar.gz'.

To test the package:
   python setup.py test [-a "<optional co3argparse args>"] [-c <config file>] [-p "<optional pytest args>"]
   e.g. python setup.py test -a "--org=Test" -c ~/my.config -p "-s"
