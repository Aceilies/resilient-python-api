# If your Resilient server uses a self-signed TLS certificate, or some
# other certificate that is not automatically trusted by your machine,
# you need to explicitly tell the Python scripts that it should be trusted.
# To explicitly trust a site, download its certificate to a file, e.g:
#    mkdir -p ~/resilient/
#    openssl s_client -connect resilient.example.com:443 -showcerts < /dev/null 2> /dev/null | openssl x509 -outform PEM > ~/resilient/cert.cer
# then specify the file (remove the '#' from the line below):
# cafile=~/resilient/cert.cer
