# Simple examples for Action Module

These simple Python examples demonstrate writing custom
action processors in Python, including the basic methods
to connect to the message queue and handle action messages.

Note: for production applications we recommend using the
`resilient_circuits` module, which provides more reliability
when handling the sort of network outages and delays that
are common in real-world situations.
