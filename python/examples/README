Contained within this directory tree are several action processor examples and some utility functions.
All of the examples depend on the python library ResilientOrg, which is contained in the ResOrg directory.
Follow the instructions there for the installation.  

Included with most are Dockerfile's which can be used to run the action in a docker container.  All of the docker builds depend 
on having the installation packages for the resilient api (co3 module) and the resilient circuits module.  These need to be built
as pip installable packages so that the build can install them into the docker image.

If you choose to go down the docker path, I recommend that you map a system directory for the configuration and logging of each integration using
the docker -v localpath:containerpath construct.  doing so enables the logging to happen to a system level file (as opposed to within the 
docker container) 

many have scripts called dockerrun.sh  these are examples of executing the docker container, and need to be modified for your specific
environment.
