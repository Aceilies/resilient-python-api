2017-06-14: version 28.0.30

Change the STOMP protocol implementation from 'stomp.py' to 'stompest' library,
     with a significant refactoring, for better reliability and maintainability.
Add support for STOMP connections via proxy server.
Add a dependency on 'stompest' and 'pysocks' packages
Remove old 'stomp.py'-based examples
Name unnamed actions, e.g. those initiated from v28 workflow, as '_unnamed_'
Defer subscribing to queues until all components have loaded
Fix a problem with international characters in 'get_action_field_label()'
Fix a problem with international characters in status messages and exceptions
Change to the 'app_restartable' functionality to remove a memory leak and streamline.
     Instead of fully unloading and reloading components on configuration file changes,
     Components are instead sent a 'reload' event.
Update the file_lookup example to handle the reload event
co3: Move the keyring and env argument parser from resilient_circuits into co3,
     so all config files can make use of '^xxx' (keyring) and '$xxx' (environment) values
