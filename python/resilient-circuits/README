Resilient Circuits Python module.
This provides a convenient framework for Action Module applications.


Requirements
============

The Resilient REST API is accessed by a helper module `co3` that should be
used for all Python client applications.  Install that module before you start.

Other requirements are installed when you install the package or setup.


Installing this module
======================

To install a pre-built package file:

    pip install dist/resilient_circuits-x.x.x.tar.gz


To install directly into your local Python environment:

    python setup.py install


To build the installable package file:

    python setup.py sdist --formats=gztar

This creates a single file `dist/co3-x.x.x.tar.gz` (the filename will
vary according to the current version of this repository).



Configuration
=============

Configuration parameters for the server URLs, user credentials and so on
should be provided using a configuration file.  They can optionally also
be provided on the command-line.

If the environment variable `APP_CONFIG_FILE` is set, it defines the path
to your configuration file.  The default configuration file is named
`app.config`.

The example projects includes a configuration file template, which should
be copied and edited for your environment.



Project Structure
=================

Your project should be structured as follows:
```
project/
├── app.config
├── components
│   ├── my_custom_component.py
├── lib
│   ├── helper_module1.py
│   ├── helper_module2.py
├── templates
|.. ├── template_file.jinja
├── run.py
```


### Running an example

After installing the resilient-circuits module, copy the provided components,
lib, and scripts directories and also the run.py and app.config files.
Edit the `app.config` file with parameters appropriate to your environment.
Then run the action script:

    python run.py


### Logging

Script output is logged to a file "app.log", which rotates if it grows large.
On unix systems, the script output is also sent to syslog.
You should periodically check the log for warnings and errors.
